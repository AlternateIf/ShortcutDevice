## Information about the _Huddle Lamp_

> The _Huddle Lamp_ - combining both a desk lamp and a camera - is the attempt to create a new way of interaction between the user and computers such as PCs and mobile devices.  

The built in RGB-D camera precisely tracks smartphones and tablets located within a limited area on a table. Moreover _Huddle Lamp_ observes movements of hands which allows developers to make use of cross-device interaction. Due to a web-based pairing approach users simply have to place a device below the camera and open a URL. This URL forwards them to webpage which uses _Huddle Lamps_ JavaScript API in order to make use of the the new interaction.
