# Shortcut Device

This project is based on the _Huddle Lamp_ mainly developed and implemented by Roman Raedle and Hans-Christian Jetter.  

> Huddle is a client-side JavaScript API to develop multi-device and multi-display applications. 
It allows you to turn arbitrary tables or flat surfaces into an interactive surface  
- [Roman Raedle](https://github.com/raedle/meteor-huddle)

The _Shortcut Device_ - in this case a tablet - loads the website from the _Huddle Server_. This can be achieved through any built-in browser but 
keep in mind that not every browser may support all of the _JavaScript Features_ used.
