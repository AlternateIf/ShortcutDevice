# Shortcut Device

This project is based on the [_Huddle Lamp_](https://github.com/huddlelamp/) mainly developed and implemented by Roman Raedle and Hans-Christian Jetter.  

> The _Huddle Lamp Project_ -combining both a desk lamp and a camera- is the attempt to create a new way of interaction between 
the user and devices including computers and other devices.

The _Shortcut Device_ - in this case a tablet - loads the website from the _Huddle Server_. This can be achieved through any built-in browser but 
keep in mind that not every browser may support all of the _JavaScript Features_ used.
